# MoCCasIN
The **M**edical **C**lassification **C**ode F**in**der (*for research purposes only*)

**MoCCasIN** is a [Oracle Helidon](https://github.com/oracle/helidon) based microservice, exhibiting a REST endpoint for retrieval and search of the following two medical code catalogs:

- [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems)
- [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System)

They are controlled by the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/). The WHO also maintains an online API to access that data. This microservice serves as an open source service to include those catalogs into any server application. 

MoCCasIn relies on CSV version of those catalogs, which can be obtained in Germany via the homepage of the [German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information](https://www.dimdi.de/dynamic/en/homepage/index.html).
