The **M**edical **C**lassification **C**ode F**in**der (*for research purposes only*)

**MoCCasIN** is a [Oracle Helidon](https://github.com/oracle/helidon) based microservice, and java library and a js library to visualize and search of the following two medical code catalogs:

- [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems)
- [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System)

Those are controlled by the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/).

This microservice serves as an open source service to include those catalogs into any server application. 

MoCCasIn relies on CSV versions of those catalogs, which are to be obtained via the homepage of the [German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information](https://www.dimdi.de/dynamic/en/homepage/index.html). The institute advises to not use the CSV data in order to implement medical coding software as most of the metadata is absent.
